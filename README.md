## Endpoint Debugger

Simple [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/) app which logs all headers sent by a client.

### Running this.
Run `npm i` if you haven't already, then type `npm start` or `npm run start`

The server will then be available at `localhost:{port}`

#### Hosting
If you have your own domain, I recommend learning how to use [**Cloudflared**](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) and forwarding a port from your computer through it.

If you don't have your own domain but have Visual Studio Code installed, you can forward a port in the bottom panel tab named "Ports"

If you don't have your own domain, and are unable to port forward normally, use a host. You can find some hosting providers with free tiers [**here.**](https://gist.github.com/bmaupin/d2d243218863320b01b0c1e1ca0cf5f3)
